# RoboSwish

**RoboSwish** is your personal productivity launcher with built-in focus modes, browser tab presets, and local AI chat powered by Ollama.

## Features

-  Mode Launcher: Launch multiple browser tabs based on your chosen context (Work, Code, Finance, etc.)
-  Super Focus Burst: 5-minute tunnel vision timer to boost concentration
- Theme Switching: Visually unique color schemes signal your brain it’s time to switch gears
- Ollama Chat: Local AI assistant (LLaMA or other models) built right into your desktop

## Installation

1. **Clone the repo**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/roboswish.git
cd roboswish

##  Final Tips

- **Ollama setup** is key for chat to work. Get that running, then chat in the sidebar should be fully functional.
- For **browser theming**, we can explore launching Chrome with specific profiles or extension parameters — want me to dig into that next?
