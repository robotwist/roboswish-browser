## Features

-  Mode Launcher: Launch multiple browser tabs based on your chosen context (Work, Code, Finance, etc.)
-  Super Focus Burst: 5-minute tunnel vision timer to boost concentration
- Theme Switching: Visually unique color schemes signal your brain it’s time to switch gears

## Installation

1. **Clone the repo**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/roboswish.git
cd roboswish

##  Final Tips

- **Ollama setup** is key for chat to work. Get that running, then chat in the sidebar should be fully functional.
- For **browser theming**, we can explore launching Chrome with specific profiles or extension parameters — want me to dig into that next?

You're building a productivity cockpit like no other — streamlined, focused, and quirky in all the right ways. Want a cool ASCII-style splash screen next? Or should we polish the chat handler next with error fallback and streaming response?
